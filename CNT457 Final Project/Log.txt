	Ian
	4 hours... collectively...
	-Started building server ui and commenting the code
	-built default tank class with a single derived class, all commented
	-added ammo class with all ammo types (derived classes, no internal content (abstract))

March 20, 2013
	Chris
	4 hours
	-Client connection working with player name and tank selection (sends cClientConnect)
	-Client send working (done with a 20ms timer)(sends cClientFrame)
	-Client receive working (threaded with destacking)(receives cServerFrame and invokes Render)

March 22, 2013
	Ian
	2 hours
	-Worked on server side establishing a feed back bar for frames, bytes and fragments (global context)
	-Worked on connection initialization for first connect, need to establish a check safe for guaranteed send
	 as it relies on getting the connect frame to be added to sockets list.
	- Initial connection now checks between connection frame vs game frame for decision making, no terrain yet
	-started working on the timer for screen refreshes using a instructions queue from recieved. 
	-will need a team meeting on best way of determining player recognized as server uses a list and client wants
	 an array. 

March 22, 2013
	Dan
	1.5 Hours
	-Started construction of the cAmmo class. Finished the base class elements including the constructor.
	-Need to still fill out function that does math on the Max Ammo Distance.
	-Constructed the cSpecialItem class. Finished all elements including constructor.

March 22, 2013
	Chris
	3 Minutes
	-Converted 20ms send timer to send new frame every key-state update

March 23, 2013
	Ian
	3.5 hours
	-Created a method for handling tank movements and commented all neccesary items 
	-Created a method for handling instruction intake and commented all neccesary items 
	-Created a method for handling packaging of tank data for server frame send outs and commented all neccesary items 
	-Created a method for handling sending of packets to clients and commented all neccesary items 
	-IN THEORY, ready for a test run with client

March 25, 2013
	Ian
	2 hours
	-Revamped server to use a structure instead of key value pair nonsense
	-Successfully connected client to server, now just working on rendering
	-instructions to server are being interpreted and logged for debug purposes
	-have noticed an interesting issue with render that requires attention

March 25, 2013
	Ian
	1 hour
	- managed to successully get render working
	- changed client to use a single frame that is constantly reassigned when a new one arrives
	- render now in a 20ms timer, this way the client still renders even if frames do not show up

March 26, 2013
	Ian
	4 hours collective
	- successfully added a terain and added an index to each tank to indicate who to render where
	- managed to get one tank to run successfully, two tanks on a screen results with a tank getting wedged at
	0,0 with no movement, on his screen he is moving and the other is not, seems like an issue updating enemy stats
	- server appears to be working correctly although a bit laggy on connection, possibly my house
	- started steps towards getting shots fired but was stalled by dumb 2 tank problem

March 27, 2013
	Ian
	1 hours collective
	- fixed issues with tanks not rendering correctly, now all frames identify correctly
	- added index to tank frames to allow for one type of frame sendout, reduce packet issues
	- added bullets to game, single type only, need to fix keyvalue pair type from float to type
	by using a encryptor, type to enum, and decryptor 

March 27, 2013
	Dan
	1.5 Hours
	- Planned out how to determine ammo fire rates for slow and fast ammo types.
	- Created properties that retrieves the values needed to assign ammo fire rates.
	- edited the Slow and fast ammo types to assign a fire rate to the types.

March 27, 2013
	Ian
	1 Hour
	- Created static class for Ammo assembly inorder to convert type to int then back again, reducing packet size
	- worked with dan creating firerate method from server, without needing to inform the client, crafty
	- fixed issue with loading a tank on client side by adding a reduced funtion version constructor, fixed bullet offset issue
	
March 28, 2013
	Ian
	5 Hours
	- solved issue around limiting connection to 4 players, with add ons on drop.
	- added features to include multiple tank types including static methods used to encode and decode 
	on client and server
	- created border, and obstacles for game elements
	- working on regions and hit detection, regions do work but do not allow for much leway, will have to
	reconsider approach used, such as after region check, possible creation of new item instance

March 29, 2013
	Ian
	3 Hours
	- started process of adding multiple ammo types to the game, fast ammo appears, to be working, slow is now broken
	offsets are also a fair bit off due to loading wrong constructor, must create dual constructor.
	- will have to refix ammo types and verify that the correct calls are made, will also have to create ammo toggles.

March 30, 2013
	Ian
	3 hours
	- created ammo collision and presets for adding to scoreboard
	- added life meter both for enemies and main player
	- bullet contact deducts life from opposing player
	- created region detection between tanks to not allow overlap, now must figure out how to determine how damage will
	be distributed

March 31, 2013
	Ian
	3 Hours
	- created toggle for secondary and primary ammo as well as different ammo looks
	- reset damage rates to be a bit more balanced
	- widened the turret and base to allow for better detailed bullets
	- created speed offset to manipulate ammo distance and speed if shot while moving
	- added radar to primary screen, 


April 1, 2013
	Ian
	3 hours collective
	- solved toggle issue with chris by adding it to frame recieve with an individually sent frame type
	- edited each tank to have line outline (for clarity)
	- having issue with region detection (inch up methods dont appear to work correctly, as they dont touch in game but are
	interpreted as intersecting), will have to look deeper >>>>>>> .r370

April 1, 2013
	Dan
	1.5 Hours
	- created the 4th tank, worked on getting the turret to function properly on it
	- worked on health and speed and turret speed to make tank unique

	- redid the graphics for tank 2 to make hit-detection easier
	- worked on client stats screen to be displayed upon death

April 3, 2013
	Dan
	1 Hour
	- created the cOilSlick class which is a derived class from the cSpecialItem class
	- the position of the oil slick will be randomly generated in a +/- 4 pixal range from the position of the tank
	**NOTE: Still need to test implimentation of the oil slick

April 3, 2013
	Ian
	5 hours
	- successfully implemenented the scoreboard for the tank game as well as the repawn of the tank on death.
	- built the basic framework to indicate that the tank is imobilized and will need to add rendering functions to show death
	- tweaked tank 4 to be a bit more detailed
	- still need to solve issue with tank on tank collision

April 4, 2013
	Ian 
	5 Hours
	- successfully added both sepecial item implenetations, including arm times, durations, damage toggles, refresh allowance

	GROUP REPORT SECTION
	------------------------------------


	1.0 Introduction
	-----------------------
		Upon first meeting we started our planning stages for our tank game. The requirments were clear and we met in hopes of 
	creating a unique, smooth running and overall fun tank game that we would potentially want to play at home. In our beginning
	planning stages we were hoping to create a game that had a space theme to it similar to how Star Fox 64 for the Nintendo 64
	was made. We soon realized this would be much more difficult than expected as well as the implimentation of this when trying
	to create the 3D model would be near impossible. Time was an issue when dealing with terrain elevation because we simply did
	not	have the time to work on the math to make it functional in our program. Once we fully realized that this idea could not
	be used	we switched to a theme of having mutiple tank types with different attributes on a grass or field type of terrain. Our
	goal was to incorporate a Tank, Ammo, Terrain and Obstacle classes that would have derived classes off of them to give mutiple
	options towards each.  



	2.0 ACTION ITEMS
	-----------------------
	-- discuss planning stages, our pseudo code
	-- discuss order we started building
	-- discuss theory in how we wanted to impliment certain parts
		-- discuss in which order we implemented processes


	3.0 PROBLEMS DISCOVERED
	-----------------------

	-- discuss our region issue, debugging steps we took, how it demoralized us. 
	-- discuss server lag issues


	4.0 SOLUTIONS DISCOVERED
	-----------------------

	-- what we learned about the initialization of regions, how we fixed our region errors
	-- memory stream reallocation for the server lag/non responsive fix


	5.0 CONCLUSION
	-----------------------

	-- discuss how our group worked together(overall very good)
		-- what we learned about utilizing the strengths of each member to have a successful outcome
		-- what we learned about working in groups
		-- how we communicated relatively well
			-- almost always collectivally told eachother what was going on outside of what was written in the log to bring clarity
			   to the subject being discussed
